# Project 2 - Tyler Ro

# Name

Tennis Courts in Toronto

# Description

Whether you are new to the city, new to the hobby, or find yourself looking for a tennis court in an unfamiliar neighbourhood, everyone should be able to access the public amenities that the city provides. This specific full stack CRUD app focuses on bringing people to tennis courts. Being that we are collectively a community, everyone is welcome to share their locations that others might not know of.

# Visuals

Can be found within the images folder of this project's Github.

# Installation

This was made using Node/Express/MongoDB from the ground up. It utilizes a 1:M relationship as anybody is able to comment a review and a rating to accompany a tennis court posting so as to add other opinions.

# Roadmap

Big incoming changes

1. An entire rework and revamp of the CSS properties to allow for a most optimized user experience. While vague, this means creating a much neater listing functionality similar to the reviews you might find on Amazon where the commented reviews are able to be seen in a very neat and organized manner. This very barebones approach to the CRUD app leaves a lot to be desired but leaves just as much room for satisfaction to be met.
2. Initiating a feature that produces an average rating (takes into account every rating a person leaves and calculates out the average from 1-5). To pair with this, a sort function that allows to be able to see the tennis courts in an ordered list with options of proximity and average numerical rating able to be chosen. Share your location and find the court nearest you! Alternatively, to those with a high eye, sort by rating best to worst and see what the community seems to deem the best in the city!
3. Tennis court postings will urge posters to kindly attach photos as well for enjoyable viewer experience as consumption begins with the eyes. Show the court so other users can see the reasoning behind any positive or negative comments.
